This trading setup is followed by the book of Carter, John F - Mastering the trade proven techniques for profiting from intraday and swing trading setups.

The play is called Fake Orgasm and goes like this : 

1. Look at stocks that are making new 52-week highs.
2. For stocks making new highs, look for a bearish divergence using a seven-period RSI (relative-strength index).When prices make higher highs and, at the same time, the RSI makes lower highs, this is called a bearish divergence. The RSI measures the power of the move, and this is telling the trader that the stock is losing power.
3. For stocks that are making new highs, look for a significant decrease in volume. This is the equivalent of a car running out of gas. There’s no sustained price movement without volume.
4. Short the stock the day after it closes below the previous 52-week high.
5. To exit, use a close above the high of the low day while above key support. If key support is broken, stay in the trade until there’s a close above the high of the low hour on a 60-minute chart.
Don’t trail stops. The exit is the price reversal signal.
